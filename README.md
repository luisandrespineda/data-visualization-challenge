Data Visualization Challenge

This repos will be used to submit HW 5, Data Visualization Challenge.

The HW file is located within the Pymaceuticals folder and is called pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb

I used class activities as a guide to write the base of the code.

Stack Overflow and ChatGPT were used to troubleshoot the code.

Special mention to the Sam Zun, our class TA, who guided me through ideas on how to loop through the existing DataFrames to create the list necessary for the second half of the assignment. His tips were essential to getting me back on track and finish the assignment.
